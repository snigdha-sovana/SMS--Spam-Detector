# SMS Spam Detector

## Overview

SMS Spam Detector is a machine learning-based web application that classifies SMS messages as either spam or ham (legitimate message). The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to detect fraudulent and promotional messages.

The application provides a simple web interface where users can enter a message and instantly see whether it is spam or genuine.
